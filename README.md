# Welcome to `lemonfold.io`

This is a blueprint of my personal monorepo for

* $\LaTeX$ documents (CV, publication record templates included)
* My self-hosted [static blog](https://lemonfold.io) created with sphinx; mostly shamelessly copied from [Chris Hodgraf's blog](https://predictablynoisy.com/posts/2020/sphinx-blogging/)
* A private blog for personal notekeeping with markdown
